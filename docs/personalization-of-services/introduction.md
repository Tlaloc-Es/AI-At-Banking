Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in banking to personalize services for customers. Here are some examples of the types of service personalization being attempted in banking with the help of AI:

* **Personalized offers of products and services**: AI can analyze a customer's transaction history, spending patterns, and preferences to offer personalized offers of products and services that are more relevant to them.
* **Personalized investment recommendations**: AI can be used to analyze a customer's financial information and provide personalized investment recommendations based on their risk profile and financial goals.
* **Personalized financial advice**: AI can be used to provide personalized financial advice based on a customer's financial needs and goals.
* **Customized portfolio management**: AI can be used to manage a customer's investment portfolio and automatically adjust it to fit changes in market conditions and customer preferences.
* **Personalized customer service**: AI can be used to provide more personalized customer service by offering solutions to customer issues and inquiries based on their transaction history and preferences.

Service personalization with the help of AI can enhance the customer experience and increase customer satisfaction by offering services and recommendations that are more relevant and tailored to each customer's individual needs and goals.
