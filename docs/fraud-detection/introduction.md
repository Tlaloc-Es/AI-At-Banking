# Introduction


The banking industry has to deal with various types of fraud and financial crimes. Here are some examples of the types of fraud that banks attempt to detect:

* **Credit card fraud**: when someone uses a credit card without the cardholder's consent or when someone counterfeits a credit card.
* **Electronic transfer fraud**: when someone attempts to obtain personal or financial information from a bank account holder in order to make an unauthorized electronic transfer.
* **Phishing**: a method in which criminals attempt to obtain confidential information, such as passwords or account numbers, by posing as a trusted entity, such as a bank, in fraudulent emails or websites.
* **Loan fraud:** when someone attempts to obtain a loan on behalf of another person using false or stolen information.
* **Money laundering**: when someone attempts to conceal the illegal origin of funds by transferring them through bank accounts.
* **Check fraud**: when someone counterfeits a check or attempts to deposit a fake check into a bank account.
